# Code-Quiz

## Description:
This is an coding assesment quiz application to help prepare for job interviews, this application is a quiz with multiple choices, and displays users highest scores. It was the most challenging development experince thus far for me to write a code that consists of object, array, for loop, if statements, time intervals, set/get items and on. There was lots of frustrating moments yet found joys during the course of learning.
